For the Project_0 aka the Bank app please open BankMain.java and follow the prompts
You can add a account under Register but while the value will be saved it will not accessible due to troubles I have had with serilization
For Login you can use Username: Name and Password: pass (both are case sensetive) After words you can withdraw or deoposit from the account
Values will not be saved outside of the arraylist the account is stored.
I do have methods for if you are employee and admin but are not fully implemented.
