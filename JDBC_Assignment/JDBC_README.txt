Everything should work! Go to JDBCBank.Banking.Driver class and hit run. Menu instructions ask for number inputs except for login.

-------------------------------------------------
There are usernames/accounts already on file. Basic example:
For login name, enter "cleave"
For password, enter "123"

For Admin access:
Login name, enter "admin"
Password, "123"
--------------------------------------------------

Things incomplete:

-Logging transactions to database. Logging only applies to creating a .log file for Account transactions.

-JUnit testing incomplete. Does exist in test.UnitTests and involves Tests for basic functions, but not all transactions.

-Need more custom exceptions. Does exist for Withdrawing/Deleting accounts.

-Formatting's not the best, may need to scroll up for certain feedback.
